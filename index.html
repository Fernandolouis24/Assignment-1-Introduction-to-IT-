<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>My name is Fernando Louis Tumeleng, people usually call me Fernando, Fer, Nando. I am from Indonesia, specifically in a city located in North Sulawesi Island called Manado. I am taking Bachelor of IT and this is my first semester. I have graduated in Diploma of IT before in PSB academy Singapore but decided to move and taking my Bachelor degree here in Australia. I spend most of my time with my friends and strangers playing online games such as Dota 2, Valorant, fall guys, GTA 5 online, etc. Another thing that I love to do is watch a movies or TV series and I also enjoy watching the NBA and play basketball.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>Since childhood, I have always been interested in things that are related with technology. I feel like thereâ€™s always something new and interesting every time big tech companies launch their new products. I still remember the first time I created my Facebook account, it just felt really weird and cool at the same time, to communicate with my friends and family virtually through that platform.</p>
<p>I decided to study at RMIT initially because of the recommendation from my agent back in Indonesia. Then, after I did some research about the university on the internet, I am more convinced because I find many testimonials from former students saying that at RMIT university there would be a lot of practical activities during the study, so it can help and be beneficial for my future career.</p>
<p>I hope to learn and fully understand about each course concepts and the basic principles, and able to apply all the knowledge that I get from my study to solve problems in real life situation in my future jobs.</p>
