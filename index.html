<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p1>My name is Fernando Louis Tumeleng, people usually call me Fernando, Fer, Nando. I am from Indonesia, specifically in a city located in North Sulawesi Island called Manado. I am taking Bachelor of IT and this is my first semester. I have graduated in Diploma of IT before in PSB academy Singapore but decided to move and taking my Bachelor degree here in Australia.

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p2>Since childhood, I have always been interested in things that are related with technology. I feel like there is always something new and interesting every time big tech companies launch their new products. I still remember the first time I created my Facebook account, it just felt weird and cool at the same time, to communicate with my friends and family virtually through that platform. furthermore, I decided to study at RMIT initially because of the recommendation from my agent back in Indonesia. Then, after I did some research about the university on the internet, I am more convinced because I find many testimonials from former students saying that at RMIT university there would be a lot of practical activities during the study. Therefore, I hope to learn and fully understand about each course concepts and the basic principles, and able to apply all the knowledge that I get from my study to solve problems in real life situation in my future jobs.</p2>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
<p>My project will be about an application that help people find a local tour guide to help them explore a specific area, whether it’s a popular tourist area or remote and rarely known area. Before covid happened, I like to travel to another city in Indonesia or travelling to another country, and this idea come from my concern every time I travel or move to a new country. Since I arrive here in Melbourne, I just walk around the city area, but I really want to explore every café, restaurant, activities that I can try, and interesting places in the suburbs as well. However, the recommendations on the internet mostly just in the cbd area, and that is why this app can help people who want to explore and find out nice place which has not been posted on the internet (hidden gem).  This application will also provide benefits for both parties because people who live in the local area get a new job, whereas people who use the service can get a new experience and get recommendations from a local about good restaurants or activities to do in that area. It will be accessible on smartphone (Android/IOS) and windows to make it easier for people to access it anywhere and anytime.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After finished installing this application on the user’s device, users will be asked to create a new account by registering an email address followed by filling in the required information such as address, phone number, interest, and entering identification (passport, id) for security reasons. After completing the personal data, the user can now choose wheter he wants to join and become a local tour guide for the application or seeking for tour guide in any particular area. For people who want to become a local tour guides, they will have to submit in more data like a photo, description about themselves, location they want to work, and their rate. On the other hand, people who look for a tour guide can directly jump in to the map page and search for a specific area that they want to explore. Afterwards,  a list of tour guide in the area will come out complete with their hobby, interest and details of the schedule about the places they will visit and also the estimated time of the tour and the price  (individual/groups), and after both parties agree, meeting point and time will come out and the arrival time of the tour guide will be more early. Other features in this application is after the tour is finished, the user can give a tip, rating, and comment about their experience with the tour guide and how they can improve their services. Through this ratings and comments, other users can be helped when choosing a tour guide, it is also can helped and improve the rating in the tour guide profile.</p>
