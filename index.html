<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>&nbspn;&nbspn;Since childhood, I have always been interested in things that are related with technology. I feel like thereâ€™s always something new and interesting every time big tech companies launch their new products. I still remember the first time I created my Facebook account, it just felt really weird and cool at the same time, to communicate with my friends and family virtually through that platform.
&nbspn;&nbspn;I decided to study at RMIT initially because of the recommendation from my agent back in Indonesia. Then, after I did some research about the university on the internet, I am more convinced because I find many testimonials from former students saying that at RMIT university there would be a lot of practical activities during the study, so it can help and be beneficial for my future career.
&nbspn;&nbspn;I hope to learn and fully understand about each course concepts and the basic principles, and also able to apply all of the knowledge that I get from my study to solve problems in real life situation in my future jobs.</p>
